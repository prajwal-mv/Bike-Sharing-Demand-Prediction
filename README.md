This repository consists of Rental Bike demand prediction required at each hour of the day so that stable supply of rental bikes
 can be made possible. This is done by applying various Regression Machine Learning Algorithms.
 
# Introduction:  

Today, bike-sharing systems are blooming across more than 1000 cities around the world, particularly in big or large cities like New York City, Paris, Washington DC, London, Beijing and Barcelona. To complete a short trip renting a bike is a faster way when compared to walking. Moreover, it is eco-friendly and comfortable compared to driving. 
Due to global warming, continuous pollution and depletion of sources of energy. Many countries have been focused on using renewable energy which doesnâ€™t harm the environment and can be reused as well. South Korea is one of the countries which has adapted to it and their most used service is rented bikes in Seoul. But in order to avoid any difficulties such as waiting time it is necessary to have an estimate of future demand. Our goal here is to build a model that can predict bike sharing demand considering all the factors which have their effects.


# Problem Statement

Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

# Approach: 

Here first we imported a data set and performed EDA where we got valuable insights and further we Encoded the Categorical Columns, Feature scaling and fitting into the models.  At first we tried with basic linear regression and also with Lasso regularization technique but soon realized we will need a much more complex model and so we then used a Decision tree Regressor, XGB Model and Random Forest Regressor compared the results.

# Conclusion: 

* Most numbers of Bikes were rented in Summer, followed by Autumn, Spring, and Winter.
* May-July is the peak Bike renting Season, and Dec-Feb is the least preferred month for bike renting.
* Majority of the client in the bike rental sector belongs to the Working class.
* This is evident from EDA analysis where bike demand is more on weekdays, working days in Seoul.
* Temperature of 20-30 Degrees, evening time 4 pm- 8 pm, Humidity between 40%-60% are the most favorable parameters where the Bike demand is at its peak.
* Temperature, Hour of the day, Solar radiation, and Humidity are major driving factors for the Bike rent demand.
* Feature and Labels had a weak linear relationship, hence the prediction from the linear model was very low. Best predictions are obtained with a Random forest model with an accuracy of 0.875.
